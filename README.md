# UnderConstruction

A full-stack web application built with React, Express, and MongoDB for managing your client information, work orders, and worker tasks. It features user authentication, protected routes, and a modern UI styled with Tailwind CSS. This functional work order and task system helps your startup company stay organized. A built-in notes feature lets managers organize and communicate directly with workers via their dashboards.

## How to Use the Application

### Manager Registration & Product Key

- Register as a **Manager** with name, email, password, and your unique **Product Key** (provided by app developer).
- Only one manager account is active at a time (future updates will support multiple managers).
- Your **Manager Key** is shown on your **Profile** page and can be rotated to maintain security.

### Worker Registration

- From the registration dropdown, select **Worker**.
- Enter name, email, password, and the Manager‚Äôs Key to register.

### Dashboard

- Add, edit, and delete **Notes** to organize tasks.
- **Pin** important notes (pushpin icon) and mark them **visible to workers** (person icon).
- Workers only see visible notes on their dashboards. They cannot modify or remove them.

### Clients (Manager Only)

- View a searchable list of all clients by name, phone, or address.
- Toggle between **grid** and **list** views.
- Click **Add Client** to open the client form (all fields required; use "NA" if needed).
- Clients cannot be deleted; records are permanent but can be edited.
- Click a client card to view **Client Details** (edit info or start a new work order).

### Work Orders

1. On the **Client Details** page, review existing work orders or click **Create Work Order**.
2. Confirm client info or add alternative contact details.
3. Set start date/time, promised completion date/time, notes, and status (can be edited later).
4. Create the work order, then add **Tasks**:
   - Provide a description (recommended: estimate hours, detailed notes).
   - Assign a single worker (future updates will allow multiple assignees).
5. Workers can only update assigned task **status** and **notes**.

> **Warning:** Leaving the page before clicking **Create Work Order** will discard all progress.

### Work Orders List

- Access via the **Work Orders** nav bar.
- Filter by status or search by client name, order number, or assigned worker.
- Toggle between grid and list views.
- Click any work order card to view and edit details or tasks.
- Change work order status among **OPEN**, **ON HOLD**, **IN PROGRESS**, **IN REVIEW**, **COMPLETED**.

### Profile & Logout

- **Logout** triggers a confirmation and sessions expire after 8 hours.
- **Profile** page: view and edit name, email, and password.

### Responsive Design

- Fully responsive layouts; nav buttons become icons on smaller screens.

## Learning Moments & Obstacles

### Key Takeaways

- **Scope management:** As this was my largest project, I learned to balance feature ambition with delivery timelines.
- **Testing complexity:** Writing unit tests for routes, controllers, and authentication underscored the need to isolate logic for maintainable, reliable tests.

### Memorable Obstacle: Password Encryption

While implementing user updates, I encountered a bug where updating a password resulted in double encryption. I inspected middleware runs and realized that a second bcrypt hash occurred on updates‚Äîonce during schema `pre('save')` and again in my update logic. Removing the redundant hash step fixed authentication and reinforced careful handling of encryption hooks.
